This project represents an update of a previous project I developed during the Rocketseat course. It involves a small component of an e-commerce system where users can add products to their cart and make edits.

The primary goal of this update was to practice and implement new technologies. I chose Tailwind for styling and Zustand for global state management. Additionally, I utilized Next.js and Typescript in the development process. The project was deployed using Vercel.
